The purpose of the make up assignment, is to provide everyone with a chance to, *make up* for any missed work.



**Due Date:** March 26 23:30



**Instructions**

Using only the [Arch Linux Official Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#top-page), install Arch Linux on a VM. Avoid using any additional tutorials, the Arch Installation instructions are updated often, and other tutorials will generally be out of date.



Work your way through the first **4** Stages, from *pre-installation* to successfully *rebooting*.

As you work your way through the installation guide, document your process. Include screenshots and describe the steps you are taking. 

- What do the commands you are running do?

- What purpose do files that you edit serve?

- Why are you creating those files, or changing certain parameters?

- ...

The document that you write should serve two purposes:

1. If you had to do this again, or someone else had to do this, it would be possible to complete an Arch Linux install using only your document.

2. Your document should demonstrate an understanding of the steps. The installation guide is very detailed, and provides links to additional resources for most steps. The expectation is that you work your way through the guide and learn more about how a Linux operating system works in the process.



You can use VirtualBox, or VMWare, or Parallels, or UTM.  You don't have to document the steps needed to create a new VM, start where the Arch guide starts, *acquire an installation image*.



**Grading**

**5 points**. You successfully complete all the required steps in the guide. Your document demonstrates sufficient understanding of the material.

**4 points**. You have successfully completed most of the required steps in the guide. Your document is pretty good.

**3 points**. You have completed a little more than half of the steps. Your document needs work, demonstration of understanding is acceptable, but could be improved.

**2 points**. You have made some progress, but have completed less than half of the assignment. Your document doesn't demonstrate sufficient understanding of the material, or is incomplete.
